# SpeechIt
Our project is a virtual AI speech coach designed to help individuals improve their public speaking skills. We understand that speaking in public can be a daunting task, leading to anxiety and stress, which can affect communication and confidence. Our app offers a solution to overcome these barriers and assist individuals in achieving effective public speaking.

Using advanced technology, our app listens to the user's speech and detects their facial expressions and corresponding emotions. It then analyzes the speech and provides feedback on areas for improvement, helping users to learn and grow. With our app, users can practice in the comfort of their own space, gaining confidence and honing their skills. Our goal is to help individuals become better communicators and succeed in their personal and professional lives.
